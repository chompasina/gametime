### Pahlka Posse
  All three members of our team are members of the Pahlka Posse at the Turing school. This is a group that focuses on civic tech and designing software with useful and conscientious themes, often for non-profit organizations. Even though our discussions in Pahlka explored complex issues around healthy food choices, we are excited to adapt the theme of healthy eating for our Module 4 gametime project. We are looking forward to contributing our new game (geared at kids 5-8), into a larger multi-game narrative project that our Pahlka Posse is building over time.
